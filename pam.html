<h1>Promotional Airtime Manager (PAM) </h1>


<p>

Most broadcasters face many challenges in maximising the power of their On-Air broadcast marketing activities at a time when increasing competition requires improving marketing effectiveness. These challenges often include:
</p>
<br class="blank" />
<p> 
<ul>
<li>Limited staff resource stretched across a growing portfolio of channels, services, brands and media </li>
<li> Increased need for more sophisticated planning approaches to maximise the ROI of marketing activities</li>
<li>Campaign overdemand on available owned media resource</li>
<li>Excess paperwork and double-entry across multiple systems, including the increasing need to
feed campaign plans to optimisers</li>
<li>Siloed processes that limit On Air cross-portfolio strategies & integration</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br class="blank" />

<p>

Other systems, such as optimisers, are only partial solutions that may provide airtime efficiencies but have limited capability in driving marketing effectiveness. PAM is a low-cost, user friendly application that aims to help broadcasters overcome these challenges and can integrate with existing broadcast systems.

<h1>What is PAM and what are the Benefits?</h1>

<p>PAM is a central campaign planning hub that allows users to manage, organise and forward plan campaign activity across a portfolio of channels, services and media platforms. It offers benefits to broadcasters by:</p>

<p>
<br class="blank" />
<ul>

<li>Providing efficiencies in terms of staff resource and use of owned media inventory</li>
<li>Improving planning effectiveness by aiding best on-air practice and portfolio integration</li>
<li>Delivering technical benefits as a cloud based application that works alongside optimisation and broadcast scheduling systems</li>
<li>Offering value for money</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br class="blank" />
<p>It is an online hub that holds campaign information for broadcasters, in particular the detailed media plans that are needed to ensure campaigns are planned and implemented effectively across all owned media services, as well as paid for media.</p>


<br class="blank" />
<p><strong>At its heart, PAM enables broadcasters to simply manage the following:</strong></p>
<br class="blank" />
<ul>

<li>Allows the creation of long term marketing campaign activity, in the shape of a forward plan, at both a portfolio, channel, genre and audience level</li>
<li>Manage available weekly promotional inventory in spots or GRPs, including 30” equivalent if required</li>
<li>Different campaign measures can be captured; ratings, spots, impressions, or actual budgets</li>
<li>View the complete campaign mix of multiple target audiences/ channels/ genres and
promotion durations</li>
<li>Effectively balance this dynamic mix of marketing activity to identify periods of over/ under demand, gaining clarity on promotional media and creative production resource issues</li>
<li>Allows media planning/ presentation teams or broadcast systems to pull the information needed to schedule promo campaigns against given targets (ratings/ spots)</li>
<li>Can capture campaign activity beyond linear TV, such as online, VOD, radio and off air</li>
<li>Reporting and tracking of planned On Air activity at various levels of detail i.e. channel, genre, audience group, priority level, for both operational and business demands</li>
<li>Provides the wider business with an up to date snapshot of campaign activity and easy to access reporting with various filter options</li>
<li>Has the ability to initiate a creative make-list or export data into external production system</li>
<li>Allows integration with any 3rd party broadcast management system or optimiser (see below)</li>

</ul>

<h1>Where does PAM fit within the On-Air Process?</h1>

<br class="blank" />

<img src="images/pam/pam-process.jpg">

<br class="blank" />


<br class="blank" />
<p>
<h1>PAM has 3 key components to help effectively manage your on-air activities on an on-going basis:</h1>
</p>


<p><strong> 1.  Promotional Model </strong></p>

<br class="blank" />
<p>This holds detailed information for either a campaign model or a series of campaign templates that are regularly used in planning. These templates hold information regarding campaign shapes, weights, target audiences and channel mix. The templates provide a very quick and user friendly way to create upcoming campaign plans in the airtime planner.</p>
<br class="blank" />

<p><strong> 2.  Airtime Planner </strong></p>

<br class="blank" />
<p>This is the heart of PAM. The planner is an interactive campaign grid that allows all campaign activity across the portfolio to be viewed and managed in one place. Its major benefit is its inventory management tool - a weekly interactive planner that balances demand (campaigns) and supply (airtime).  This allows the user to easily identify weeks with over or under demand and adjust campaigns accordingly. </p>
<br class="blank" />
<p>It also enables the simple management of campaigns across multiple target audiences into one broad audience for inventory management – a task that is very time consuming for media planners.
Alongside this, it can be used as an implementation tool, giving both weekly and daily campaign rating targets in multiple audiences.  Similarly, campaign channel splits and promo time-lengths can be viewed for each campaign.</p>
<br class="blank" />
<p>The airtime planner has filters that enable only required information to be displayed depending on the user needs.
Where needed, the airtime planner can also record information about other marketing activities within a campaign i.e. off-air or digital activity, as well as information on creative executions and campaign owners.
</p>
<br class="blank" />

<p><strong>3.  Reporting </strong></p>

<br class="blank" />
<p>PAM allows for flexible reporting either visually on-screen, as PDF or export to Excel. The reporting may be used to create make-lists, use as a promo scheduling guide and also monitor and track how a broadcaster’s marketing resource is being used.  There are currently 3 types of reports:
</p>

<br class="blank" />
<p><strong>Inventory Management Report</strong></p>

<p>A useful report for capturing the overall communication mix for a broadcaster. This graphical report shows the proportion of promotional support by genre / channel or service / priority level and audience group. It allows marketing and programming to have an instant graphical picture of the total promotional support across a period to ensure it aligns with business strategies, and also enables a user to monitor levels of cross promotion on a channel.</p>
<br class="blank" />
<img src="images/pam/pam-inventory-report.jpg">



<br class="blank" />
<br class="blank" />
<p><strong>Airtime/ Campaign Detail Report</strong></p>

<p>A versatile report that allows all the detail in the airtime planner to be extracted according to the needs to the user. Different information can be switched on/off for this report to tailor it for campaign grids, makelist, commercial sponsor requirements, campaign implementational needs. detailing the campaign plans for all campaigns that fall under the parameters specified by the user, such as dates, channels, genres, platforms, creative, sponsor. This report can be saved as a PDF or exported as an excel format.
</p>

<br class="blank" />

<p><strong>Single Campaign Report</strong></p>

<p>The Single Campaign report is useful for bigger priority campaigns where lots of campaign activity is stored within PAM.  This can include any off air, digital or other platform activity.  The report breaks each episode/ week down into a calendar view so any information can be viewed and shared in detail.  This report also includes any time-length GRP information that is planned at an episode or week level.
</p>

<br class="blank" />
<br class="blank" />
<h1>Integration with Promotional Optimiser & Broadcast Management Systems</h1>
</p>


<p><strong>Import Functionality</strong> - Allows for data, such as campaign ID numbers and any important campaign information i.e titles, target audiences, TX dates etc to be imported from a broadcast management system into PAM.</p>
<br class="blank" />
<p><strong>Export Functionality</strong> - Any campaign data, along with media plans (campaign weights, shapes, channel mix, time-length usage) can be exported from PAM into any promo scheduling/ optimiser system or production tool.</p>
<br class="blank" />
<p>This provides significant resource benefits due to a reduction in admin by removing the need for multiple entry of campaign information into various systems.</p>
