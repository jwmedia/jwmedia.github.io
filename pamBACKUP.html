<h1>Promotional Airtime Manager (PAM) </h1>

<p> JWM are advocates of structuring a promotional model that takes a portfolio approach and that requires working with a mixed economy of campaign target audiences.
</p>
<br class="blank" />

<p>

The PAM application allows users to effectively manage, organise and forward plan campaign activity across the entire inventory of a broadcaster's portfolio of channels and across media platforms.  It enables all campaign activity to be held in one central repository and for all stakeholders, including Media Planning, Marketing, Operations and Creative departments to view and report on activity as required.
</p>

<li> Campaign activity is held in one central place</li>
<li>Plan and manage airtime inventory in Actual or Duration Weighted (30 sec Eq) GRPs
<li>Works alongside and integrates with optimisation systems and broadcast scheduling systems</li>
</ul>

<h1>What is PAM and what are the Benefits?</h1>

<p>PAM is an online database that holds campaign information for broadcasters, in particular the detailed media plans that are needed to ensure campaigns are planned and implemented effectively. At its heart, PAM enables broadcasters to simply manage the following:</p>

<p>
<br class="blank" />
<ul>

<li>Allows the creation of long term marketing campaign activity, in the shape of a forward plan, at both a portfolio, channel, genre and audience level</li>
<li>Manage available promotional inventory in Actual of 30 sec Eq. GRPs in detail on a weekly or daily basis</li>
<li>Different campaign measures can be captured; ratings, spots, impressions, or actual budgets</li>
<li>View the complete campaign mix of multiple target audiences/ channels / genres and promotion durations </li>
<li>Assign and plan GRPs against different creative timelengths at an individual episode / week level, as well as at a total campaign level.</li>
<li>Effectively balance this dynamic mix of marketing activity to identify periods of over/under demand, gaining clarity on promotional media and creative production resource issues  </li>
<li> Allows Media Planning/ Presentation teams or broadcast systems to pull the information needed to schedule promo campaigns against given targets (ratings / spots)</li>
<li>Can capture campaign activity beyond linear TV, such as online, VOD, off air</li>
<li>Reporting and tracking of planned On Air activity at various levels of detail i.e. channel, genre, audience group, priority level, for both operational and business demands. </li>
<li>Provides the wider business with an up to date snapshot of campaign activity and easy to access reporting with various filter options</li>
<li>Has the ability to initiate a creative make-list or export data into external production system</li>
<li>Allows integration with any 3rd party broadcast management system or Optimiser (see below)</li>

<li>Provided by an agile company that can adapt and tailor the PAM solution to client requirements without having to go through long winded software change requests</li>
</ul>

<h1>Where does PAM fit within the On-Air Process?</h1>

<br class="blank" />

<img src="images/pam/pam-process.jpg">

<br class="blank" />


<br class="blank" />
<p>
<h1>PAM has 3 key components to help effectively manage your on-air activities on an on-going basis:</h1>
</p>


<p><strong> 1.  Promotional Model </strong></p>

<br class="blank" />
<p>This holds detailed information about either a campaign model that you use or a series of campaign templates that are regularly used in planning. These templates hold information regarding campaign shapes, weights, target audiences & channel mixes. The templates provide a very quick and user friendly way to create campaigns in the airtime planner for your forward planning.</p>
<br class="blank" />

<p><strong> 2.  Airtime Planner </strong></p>

<br class="blank" />
<p>This is the heart of PAM. The planner is an interactive forward campaign grid that allows all campaign activity across the portfolio to be viewed & managed in one place. Its major benefit is its inventory management tool - a weekly interactive planner that balances demand (campaigns) and supply (airtime), hence allowing the user to easily identify weeks with over or under demand and adjust their forward planning accordingly. </p>
<br class="blank" />
<p>It also enables the simple management of campaigns across multiple target audiences into one broad audience for inventory management – a task that can be very time consuming for media planners.
Alongside this, it can be used as an implementation tool, giving weekly, or even daily, campaign rating targets in multiple audiences and the channel split across the campaign.</p>
<br class="blank" />
<p>The airtime planner has filters that enable only relevant information to be displayed, depending on the user needs.
Where needed, the airtime planner can also record information about other marketing activities within a campaign, i.e. off-air activity, web activity, as well as information about creative timelengths and campaign owners.
</p>
<br class="blank" />

<p><strong>3.  Reporting </strong></p>

<br class="blank" />
<p>PAM allows for flexible reporting either visually on-screen, print/save as a PDF or export to Excel. The reporting may be used to create make lists, use as a promo scheduling guide, as well as monitor and track how a broadcaster’s most important marketing resource is being used.  There are currently 2 types of reports:
</p>

<br class="blank" />
<p><strong>Inventory Management Report</strong></p>

<p>Report showing proportion of promotional support by genre / channel / priority level and audience group. It allows marketing to get an easy to view graphical picture of the total promotional support across a period. It also enables a user to monitor levels of cross promotion on a channel.  </p>
<br class="blank" />
<img src="images/pam/pam-inventory-report.jpg">



<br class="blank" />
<br class="blank" />
<p><strong>Airtime/ Campaign Detail Report</strong></p>

<p>A report giving the campaign plans for all campaigns that fall under the parameters specified by the user.  E.g. All campaigns running ON XTV in weeks 40 and 41 (useful for channel planners as they are responsible for delivering all activity on their channel, both host & cross promotion).  E.g. All campaigns FOR XTV in October (useful for makelist meetings)  E.g. All drama campaigns across the Autumn (useful for marketing planning)
</p>

<br class="blank" />

<p><strong>Single Campaign Report</strong></p>

<p>The Single Campaign report is useful for bigger priority campaigns where lots of campaign activity is stored within PAM.  This can include any off air, digital or other platform activity.  The report breaks each episode/ week down into a calendar view so any information can be viewed and shared in detail.  This report also includes any time-length GRP information that is planned at an episode or week level.
</p>

<br class="blank" />
<br class="blank" />
<h1>Integration with Promotional Optimiser & Broadcast Management Systems</h1>
</p>


<p><strong>Import Functionality</strong> - Allows for data, such as Asset ID numbers and any important campaign information i.e titles, target audiences, TX dates etc to be imported into PAM.</p>
<br class="blank" />
<p><strong>Export Functionality</strong> - Any campaign data, along with media plans (campaign weights, shapes, channel mix, time-length usage) can be exported from PAM into any promo scheduling/ optimiser system or production tool.</p>
<br class="blank" />
<p>Provides significant resource benefits and admin to be minimised by reducing the need for double entry of campaign information into various systems. </p>
