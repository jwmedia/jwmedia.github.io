            <p>"Even though I had heard good things from other business contacts about JWM's expertise, we at DR never anticipated the clarity of thinking, allied to the detailed promotional model that they formulated for us across our portfolio of TV, radio and digital- some 16 services in total. Their work for us using their ARR process has allowed us to rethink our whole on air marketing approach, which ensures that both our airtime and creative resource is used both effectively and efficiently and at the same time helping to fulfil our key business needs".</p>

            <p>“I tasked JWM to review A+E Networks UK promotional strategy and implementation across the EMEA region looking to drive ROI around the world by maximising the effectiveness of our inventory.
            The recommendations range from the introduction of time saving systems, more streamlined and effective processes and essential structural changes to deliver the recommended prioritisation model.
            The money I invested in JWM’s ARR service will deliver exponential savings for our business across the globe.”

JWM analysis and recommendations have helped us a great deal to move from product oriented on-air marketing to much more effective ways of communication with our audiences on a portfolio level. Also, thanks to their planning tool PAM we have much clearer internal communication with our colleagues across our wider organisation."</p>

Their breadth of experiences from the world of broadcast Media Planning ensures the training is delivered in an open and engaging way and has resulted in a boost in the teams’ ability to manage campaigns and confidence in dealing with internal stakeholders.
