    <h1>Broadcast Promotional Strategy</h1>
    <p><span class="highlight"><strong>Service benefits:</strong></span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Efficient use of promotional airtime and creative resource</li>
        <li>Improved effectiveness of marketing activity</li>
        <li>Integration of marketing activities across all services including TV, VOD, radio &amp; online</li>
        <li>Increased viewing, awareness and revenues (if appropriate)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As the world of broadcast media continues to evolve at an ever increasing pace and costs come under closer scrutiny, it is critical that companies make maximum use of their own much demanded resources. 
        On-air promotional airtime, although free of charge, has a huge opportunity cost associated with it, often running to tens or hundreds of millions of €/$ per annum.
    </p>
    <br class="blank" />
    <p>
        Failure to make the best use of this airtime leads to ineffective promotional strategy.  This impacts upon the ability of broadcasters to maximise their marketing potential and fulfil both their audience requirements and company objectives; both short-term and further in the future.
    </p>
      <br class="blank" />
    <p>
        Inefficiencies will also occur as sub-optimal use of promotional space will result in unnecessary creative production demands.
    </p>
        <br class="blank" />
           <p> Our <strong>ARR</strong> service; through <strong>Audit</strong>, <strong>Review</strong> and <strong>Recommend</strong>; will give your promotional capability a health check, produce a tailored promotional model &amp; ensure that any inefficiency is minimised and effectiveness of resource increased.</p>
                   <br class="blank" />


                <h1>Audit of Promotional Inventory </h1>
            <ul>
            <li>How much promotional airtime/ GRPs/ Views/ Page impressions are available by channel/ portfolio?</li>
            <li>How do viewing levels convert to reach and frequency across the channels and within the portfolio?</li>
            <li>This includes optimal levels of GRPs by target group and the influence of cross promotion if appropriate.</li>
            </ul>
        <h1>Review</h1>
        <ul>
        <li>An analysis of current on- air practices, including: What is the current prioritisation process? How many campaigns do you produce? What shape do these campaigns follow?</li>
        <li>An understanding of key objectives, KPIs, challenges and restrictions that the business works within.</li>
        <li>An understanding of how campaigns are commissioned planned and implemented.</li>
          <br class="blank" />
       <p> As part of this module, we would seek to understand the current decision-making process, requirements and restrictions regarding the use of promotional airtime.</p>
       </ul>
       <h1>Recommend</h1>
       <ul>
       <li>This module focuses on delivering the headline recommendations to maximise the impact and effectiveness of the broadcasters owned inventory</li>
       </ul>

       <p>This is not an exhaustive list but it is likely that key recommendations to deliver that full potential will fall under the following:</p>
<br class="blank" />
    <p><strong>Prioritisation & Promotional Model</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Recommended criteria that address objectives and enable robust prioritisation of content – tailored by market if applicable</li>
    <li>A promotional model tailored to the broadcaster's unique challenges that allocates available promotional inventory to a range of campaign types planned based on effective weights to maximise impact. This will include recommendations around target audiences/ channel mixes/ creative volumes and if appropriate regional allocation.</li></ul>

    <p><strong> Promotional Process</strong></p>
    <p>What works well and how could the process work better both locally and internationally? – Drawing on understanding the pros and cons of how many other broadcast organisations are structured and the processes that they use.</p>
    <br class="blank" />

    <p>The above will be presented to key stakeholders to gain buy-in to any revised airtime model and recommended changes to the on-air marketing process.</p>
